# PHP Task Tracker

This is a simple task tracking web app made of PHP, MySQL and JavaScript with Angular.

## Get Started
You need a configuration file named "secret.php" in your project root directory like this:

    <?php
      define (DB_USER,     "user_name_of_mysql");
      define (DB_PASSWORD, "password_of_mysql");
      define (DB_DATABASE, "dbname_of_mysql");
      define (DB_HOST,     "your_db_host");
    ?>
